# FrankBot v1.0
*A Discord Bot for Saving Chat Logs*

## What is FrankBot
After searching around the internet, I couldn't find a way to archive discord conversations so I could clean up our 
text channels.  So, I made one.

FrankBot will read through a Text Channel's history and save the username and message content to a text file.

## Commands

### !save
This command goes through ever sent message and saves it to a text file.

## The Future

- [x] Save Sent Messages, Links, Code
- [ ] Save Sent Photos
- [ ] Save Sent File Names
- [ ] Rebuild Archived but Deleted Chat Logs
